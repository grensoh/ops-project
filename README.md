## ðŸ“– A short description

The OPS Project is an ambitious leap into the world of space exploration, where brilliant ideas meets homemade engineering. Our mission? To design, build, and launch a small satellite, no larger than a soda can, into the skies.
>The Primary mission: 
> our CanSat is equipped to measure atmospheric temperature and pressure during its fall, transmitting the data to the ground in real-time thanks to radio signals.

>The Secondary mission:
> thanks to the combination of a light sensor, a gyroscope, and a reaction wheel, our CanSat will align itself with the sun during its fall. We'll use a PID system to measure the intensity of the sunlight and perform rotations until reaching the maximum amount of light.

## ðŸ‘¤ Who are we ?

We are a team from the school Mater Dei located in Brussels. This project was made possible thanks to the collaboration of Ethan Verbeiren, Luca Di Sarno, Alexandre Demoulin, TimÃ©o Thys, Nicolas Vargas, SimÃ©on Stoyanov, Aline Krbs, Diane Lazzarot. Special thanks to our advisor-teachers, miss Losdyck and Kervyn de MeerendrÃ©.
